Subject: [PATCH] Extend Player Interact cancellation

GUIs are opened on the client, meaning that the server cannot block them from opening,
However, it is possible to close these GUIs from the server.

Flower pots are also not updated on the client when interaction is cancelled, this patch
also resolves this.

Update adjacent blocks of doors, double plants, pistons and beds
when cancelling interaction.
